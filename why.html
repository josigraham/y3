        Mini Cooper Insol

<p>
Introducing the Mini Cooper Insol: 
<p>
A solar-powered car that drives smoother than those that run on gasoline. <br>
The Insol comes available in five colors, equipped with state-of-the-art interiors and solar panels. <br>
The Insol’s innovative solar panels are able to retrieve as much energy from the sun as possible. <br>
<p>
The creators of the Mini Cooper Insol understand that solar panels contain glass which adds weight to them. <br>
That is why the unique design and photovoltaic cells within the our car convert the sun's energy directly into <br>
electric energy, exceeding the added fuel consumption caused by the dense weight of the panels. <br>
<p>
We aim for alternative-energy powered cars to become the industry standard. Insol owners will feel proud of their <br>
contribution to the environment and the aesthetically pleasing look of their environmentally friendly car. <br>

About Insol
</h1>
<h2>
Brand Statement:
<br>
The mission of Mini Cooper Insol is to provide a state-of-the-art, solar energy powered automotive product that delivers appreciable values to all users and stakeholders.
<br>
Background Summary:
<br>
Insol’s history is established in innovation; from developing a clean-energy car that drives smoother than a car that runs on gas to featuring multiple solar panels that retrieve as much energy from the sun as possible. Insol as a brand extension of Mini Cooper aims to help solar-powered cars become the market standard.
<br>
The creators of the Mini Cooper Insol understand that solar panels contain glass which adds weight to them. In order to be successful in mobile applications, the energy gathered from a panel must exceed the added fuel consumption caused by the extra weight. The unique design and photovoltaic cells within the solar panels of the Mini Cooper Insol convert the sun's energy directly into electric energy. The energy retrieved successfully exceeds the added fuel consumption caused by the dense weight of the panels.
